I had to reduce my scope due to time and difficulty.
The things i would like to do later are:
	Implement Login for customer 
	Add a search for jersey and customer
	Add a table for sizes so sizes can be a dropdown
	Dont allow for jerseys to be added to an order when stock is 0
	Change the visual for list of jerseys and single jersey

I had to change some of the design because it did not work with what i was creating and i also had some things to add that changed some things like the view for customer because the orders would be too much for that small section

My database has tables called jerseys, orders, customers
because there can be many jerseys for one order and many orders with many jerseys there is also a bridging table called ordersJerseys.
